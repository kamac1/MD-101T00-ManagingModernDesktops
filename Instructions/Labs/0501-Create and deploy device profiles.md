# Practice Lab - Create and deploy device profiles

## Summary

In this lab, you will practice creating and applying a device profile.

### Exercise 1: Create and deploy a device profile

### Scenario

A. Datum Corporation’s has decided to manage all developers in the company using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and Intune. You have been asked to evaluate the solutions that would enable the developers to work effectively and securely on Windows 10 devices managed by Intune and Azure AD. The head of the developer department, Brenda Mueller, has volunteered to help you test and evaluate the solution and provide feedback. She has also given you some initial requirements that must be included in the configuration of Intune:

•	It should not be possible to access Gaming or Privacy in the Settings app.
•	The C:\DevProjects folder should be excluded from Windows Defender.
•	The process devbuild.exe must be excluded from Windows Defender.
•	Most used apps and Recently added apps should not be displayed on the Start menu.


#### Task 1: Verify settings on device before enrollment

1.  Sign in to **LON-CL3** as **Admin** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.

2.  On **LON-CL3**, on the taskbar, select **Start** and then select the
    **Settings** app.

3.  In the **Settings** app, verify that you can see the **Gaming** tile.

4.  Select **Privacy** and verify that you can see several customization
    options.

5.  Select the left arrow in the upper left corner.

6.  Select the **Personalization** tile and then select **Start**. Verify that
    **Show recently used apps** is set to **On**.

7.  Select the left arrow in the upper left corner.

8.  In the **Settings** app, select **Update and Security**.

9.  On the **Update & Security** page, select **Windows Security** and then
    **Open Windows Security**.

10. On the **Windows Security** page, select the menu and then select the **Virus
    & threat protection**.

11. On the **Virus & threat protection** page, select **Manage settings** under
    **Virus & threat protection settings**. Scroll down to **Exclusions** and
    select **Add or remove exclusions**.

12. On the **Exclusion** page, verify that no exclusions have been configured.

13. Close the **Exclusions page** and the **Windows Security** page by selecting
    the **X** in the right upper corner twice.

### Task 2: Enroll Windows 10 device to Azure AD and Intune using the Settings app

1.  On **LON-CL3**, with the Settings app still open, navigate to the **Accounts** page. 

2.  Select **Access work or school**. In the **Access work or school** section, select **+Connect**.

4.  In the **Microsoft account** window, on the **Set up a work or school
    account** page, select **Join this device to Azure Active Directory**.

5.  On the **Let’s get you signed in** page, in the **Work or school account**
    text box, type **DiegoS\@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com**

6.  On Enter password page, enter the default tenant password in the text box and then select
    **Sign in**.

7.  Wait a few seconds and then on the **Make sure this is your organization**
    dialog, select **Join**.

8.  On the **You’re all set!** page, select **Done**.

9.  In the **Settings** app, in the **Access work or school** section, verify
    that the device is connected to Azure AD and then close the **Settings**
    app.

10. Right-click the **Start** button and select **Windows PowerShell (Admin)**,
    when prompted select **Yes.**

11. In the PowerShell console, type the following and then press Enter:
```
    REG ADD HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\PassportForWork /v Enabled /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f 

``` 
    
_Note: This will disable Windows Hello on the device and will disable the forced
    creation of a PIN when logging on to the device the first time using an
    Azure AD account. This will also disable the need for access to a mobile
    phone as this requires validation of the Azure AD account being used. You
    can also disable the use of Windows Hello by creating a policy in Intune._

### Task 3: Logon to a different Windows 10 device using Azure AD user

1.  Sign out of **LON-CL3**. 

2.  Select **other user**, and in the **Email address** field type

    Password field, type yourtenant **Passwort** and then press Enter.

3.  Wait for the profile to be created. It will take around 30-60 seconds.

    benefit from Single-Sign-On (SSO) to Azure AD, Intune and Office 365.
