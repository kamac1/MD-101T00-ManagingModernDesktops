# Practice Lab - Deploying Windows 10 with AutoPilot

## Summary

In this lab you will learn how setup and deploy a device with Autopilot using User-driven mode.

### Scenario

IT is planning to rollout a deployment of new devices using Autopilot. The devices have a default installation of Windows 10. Users should be able to connect the device, turn it on, and answer minimal questions during the OOBE, using their Azure AD credentials to login. The process should automatically enroll and join the Azure AD domain.  You have been asked to configure and test the experience using the VM LON-CL5.

_Note: The following lab uses LON-CL5, which is a nested virtual machine
hosted on LON-HOST1. LON-CL5 is automatically provisioned using a script
when the MD-101 lab environment is first launched, which prepares the client
for this lab. This process takes approximately 30 mins, and should be ready
by the time the student is ready to perform this exercise._
